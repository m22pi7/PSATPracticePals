Hello Judges! I hope this github finds you in good health. Thank you so much for hosting this hackathon our group had a lot of fun. The challange that we decided to focus on was PSAT Practice. As I am sure you remember, studying for the PSAT is a tedious and hard task that is generally not an enjoyable process. We decided that since we all have to study for this standardized exam we may as well have fun with it. We made a program that allows the player to compete with a friend. You can have two players that are given a writing question and you race against each other and time to answer the question correctly. This allows you to not only get more accurate with you questions but also get faster. PSAT Practice Pals is the fun way to study for your PSAT Test.
