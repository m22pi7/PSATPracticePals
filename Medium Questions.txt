effect,
1
Choice A is the best answer. The semicolon after "effect" correctly joins the independent clause that begins with "he spun" and the closely related independent clause that begins with "he even."
Choice B is incorrect because a coordinating conjunction such as "and" typically doesn't follow a semicolon used in this way. Additionally, the comma after "and" is nonstandard. Choice C is incorrect because a colon used in this way introduces information that illustrates or describes information that has come before it, and what follows the colon in this case isn't an illustration or a description but rather are additional examples of Patton's skill. Additionally, the conjunction "but" incorrectly indicates a contrast between the two independent clauses. Choice D is incorrect because the comma after "effect" results in a comma splice.

Choice C is the best answer. The plural possessive determiner "their" agrees in number with the plural antecedent "Patton and other bluesmen."
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the singular possessive determiners "his," "one's," and "its" don't agree in number with the plural antecedent "Patton and other bluesmen."
As the Mississippi dusk settled on Dockery Farms on Saturday evenings' in the early 1900s, hundreds would cross a one-lane bridge to hear the blues. There, bluesmen played and sang in a repurposed home they called the Frolicking House. Once a week, the furniture was placed outdoors to make room for the burgeoning crowd, and wall-sized mirrors reflected coal oil lanterns, setting the house aglow and irradiating the way for stragglers. For anyone who could pay a twenty-five-cent fee, there was space inside next to the musicians, who sometimes played until dawn. So began the Delta blues, an influential style of music that originated among the African American farmhands of the Delta region of northwest Mississippi and was characterized by uneven rhyme schemes, moaning vocals, and mixes of sung and spoken passages. Dockery Farms, a forty-square-mile farming community with about 3,000 residents in its heyday, fell into decline after the introduction of the mechanical cotton picker in 1944. It was the home base of, among others, blues pioneer Charley Patton, whose family had moved to the farm in search of work in about 1900. At Dockery, Patton met Henry Sloan, about whom little is known except that he taught Patton to play guitar, while that changed both Patton's life and American music. Patton, who soon was making enough from his performances to call himself a professional musician, suffered from a heart condition. He spun his guitar while playing and slapped the body of the instrument for rhythmic effect; he even perfected startling tricks like playing behind his head and plucking the strings with his teeth, to the delight of listeners. His songs, first recorded in 1929, could be about anything from love affairs to floods to an insect—the cotton-eating boll weevil, immortalized in Patton's "Mississippi Boweavil Blues." Patton and other bluesmen like Tommy Johnson and Son House traveled around Mississippi, playing at dance halls and parties, spreading his distinctive style and affecting stories across the eastern United States. As more and more African Americans moved northward in the 1920s, many Delta musicians were drawn to Chicago in search of day jobs in factories—and audiences at night. Recording companies began, to take note, of Chicago's music boom, and by 1926, propelled by the blues' rising popularity, record sales by African American artists reached $5 million. The Chicago blues musicians built on the guitar- and harmonica-driven tunes of the Delta, adding percussion sections and eventually electronic amplification. But even with these modernizations, 11 Chicago quickly became the center of blues music for the country.
The writer wants a conclusion that refers back to the discussion of the origin of blues music. Which choice best accomplishes this goal?
NO CHANGE
blues was still characterized by the wailing sound created by the bottleneck slide technique.
more opportunities for recording and performing were on the horizon, especially with the rise of blues clubs
the memory of Mississippi's fields remained in the background, inspiring new generations of musicians.

Choice D is the best answer. This choice best concludes the passage by referring back to the blues music that originated on Dockery Farms in Mississippi.
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they don't pertain to the earlier discussion of the origin of blues music. The importance of the Chicago blues music scene (choice A), the characteristic sound of blues music (choice B), and the increase in recording and performing opportunities (choice C) are unrelated to African American farmhands creating blues music in the Mississippi Delta.

Choice B is the best answer. The singular possessive determiner "its" agrees in number with the singular antecedent "steamboat."
Choice A is incorrect because the plural possessive determiner "their" doesn't agree in number with the singular antecedent "steamboat." Choices C and D are incorrect because they aren't possessive determiners. "It's" is the contraction for "it is" or "it has," and "there" can be a noun, a pronoun, an adjective, or an adverb but can never be a possessive determiner.

Choice C is the best answer. The word "regarded" is the most appropriate choice when describing a person's beliefs about or view of something. In this case, people considered the steamboat to be a terrible form of transportation.
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they don't fit the context of the sentence. "Beheld" is appropriate when describing viewing something impressive. "Idealized" suggests people believed something to be perfect. "Observed" indicates people watched something closely. None of these is appropriate when describing people's poor opinion of something.
After returning to the United States three years later, Fulton decided to try again: this time he built a ship for commercial use rather than for government or naval use. While the Paris steamboat was 66 feet long, with a single paddle wheel and an 8-horsepower engine, his new steamboat—which came to be known as the Clermont—was 150 feet long, with two paddle wheels and a 24-horsepower engine.

Choice D is the best answer. This choice best sets up the next sentence's comparison between Fulton's first smaller Paris boat and his second larger New York ship. 
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they don't effectively set up the next sentence in the paragraph. The next sentence doesn't mention various types of steamboat use (choice A), public interest in Fulton's projects (choice B), or future improvements to Fulton's design (choice C).

Choice A is the best answer. The dash after "Clermont" is paired with the dash after "steamboat" to set off the nonrestrictive element.
Choices B and D are incorrect because a dash can't be paired with a comma or a colon to set off the nonrestrictive element. Choice C is incorrect because a dash is needed after "Clermont"; dashes need to be used in pairs to set off a nonrestrictive element in the middle of a sentence.

Choice D is the best answer. "In" is the idiomatic preposition in conjunction with "the public's mind" to indicate that the majority of people still remembered Fulton's initial failure.
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because "through," "from," and "among" aren't idiomatic prepositions in conjunction with "the public's mind."

Choice C is the best answer. The singular possessive noun "engine's" properly indicates that the "roar" belonged to the engine, and the singular possessive noun "ship's" properly indicates that the passengers belonged to the ship the Clermont.
Choice A is incorrect because the plural possessive noun "ships'" wrongly suggests that multiple ships are being discussed. Choices B and D are incorrect because "ships" is a plural noun; the singular possessive noun "ship's" is needed to show that there was only one ship and that the passengers belonged to it. Additionally, choice D is incorrect because "engines" is a plural noun; the singular possessive noun "engine's" is needed to indicate that the roar belonged to a single engine.

Fulton was intent on proving them wrong. Along with forty passengers, he embarked on a 150-mile upriver journey to Albany, New York. Just minutes into the voyage, though, the boat's engine stopped. In the tense moments after the engine's roar ceased, the ships' passengers began to murmur anxiously: it seemed certain that history was doomed to repeat itself. Fulton, however, fixed the engine problem within thirty minutes. When the Clermont once again began to move at full speed, Fulton recalled, "none seemed willing to trust the evidence of their own senses." Provoking a feeling of astonishment, the Clermont not only completed the 150-mile trip to Albany but did so relatively quickly. Whereas a sailboat would have taken about four days to reach Albany, Fulton's steamboat got there in just thirty-two hours. *Though Fulton was interested in many types of steam-powered vessels, the steamboat quickly became a popular mode of travel. Shortly thereafter, Fulton began running three round-trips from New York City to Albany every two 32 weeks, by 1812, steamboats operated on six major rivers. Connecting different parts of the country, steamboats made it possible for people to travel greater distances in less time;

Choice D is the best answer. This choice offers the best transition because it links the previous paragraph's description of Fulton's accomplishment to this paragraph's discussion of the ensuing transformation of river travel.
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because none of these transitional phrases shows the true relationship between the previous paragraph and this paragraph. The previous paragraph doesn't pertain to Fulton's varied interests, the development of commercial transportation, or Fulton's business acumen.
